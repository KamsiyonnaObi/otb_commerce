# Hello World!

#todayICompleted 🎉 An e-commerce website for my podcast. I built it using React, one of the most popular and powerful JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. And to manage the content, I used Sanity, a content management system that allows us to easily manage and update our product information and other content. I suggest you check them out. https://www.sanity.io/

But that's not all! I also integrated with Stripe, a leading payment processor, to make online transactions seamless and secure. With Stripe, our customers can now easily and safely purchase directly on our website.
